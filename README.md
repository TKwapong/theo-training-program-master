# training_program

A new Flutter project to showcase some training programs that an organization offers.

## Getting Started

This project had the client side and was fed with responses from an API.
The search API would perform a full text search on the training programs and return the search results in a JSON response. The JSON response should be in the format {success: true, data: training}.
Looking to hopefully update the UI more.
